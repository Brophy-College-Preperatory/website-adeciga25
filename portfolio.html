    <h2>About Pokémon</h2>
    <p>Pokémon is a globally recognized franchise that has evolved into one of the most successful and enduring entertainment properties in history. Created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, Pokémon originally began as a video game series for the Game Boy in 1996, with the goal of creating an experience that combined adventure, exploration, and the joy of collecting. Players take on the role of Pokémon Trainers, capturing and training over 800 different species of Pokémon to battle against other Trainers and become the Pokémon Champion. Each Pokémon has its own unique traits, moves, and abilities, which adds strategic depth to the games. Over time, Pokémon expanded into various forms of media, including an animated TV series, movies, trading card games, and toys, with a massive fanbase spanning across generations. The central themes of Pokémon emphasize friendship, teamwork, and personal growth, as Trainers work with their Pokémon partners to overcome challenges and strengthen their bonds. Whether through the games, the shows, or the community, Pokémon continues to inspire and entertain millions of fans worldwide.</p>
